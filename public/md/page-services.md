## Services

Appraisals may be required for many reasons. Our Oregon State Certified Residential Appraiser has 34 years experience in the valuation of homes and property for financing transactions as well as for pre-sale, estate planning, trust work, and divorce settlements. We offer multiple reports and review options in a timely manner, guaranteeing the best service to our clientele.

We provide appraisals for Conventional, F.H.A., and U.S.D.A. loan programs, in addition to appraisals for all types of residential property, including:

- Complex custom homes
- Waterfront / Oceanfront property
- Small income property
- Condominiums
- New Construction
- Manufactured homes
- Vacant Land

Our fees are considered competitive to the local, coastal industry and we strive for the highest quality work produced, with the greatest detail and attention to time sensitive issues or “quick close of escrow” periods. Please contact us today to discuss your property valuation needs.
